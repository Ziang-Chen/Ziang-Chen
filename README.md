Hi, I'm Ziang Chen, graduate from King's College London (Master Degree) ,UK & TU eindhoven (Doctorate Degress), The Netherlands

My Current working fields in High-Performance Computation and  Machine Learning. 

Past was interest in Complex system (which using Mean field Approach, aka differential equation, focous on the Numerical-stability),

Update 1/15 2026

From 2022-2025 I was working on my doctorate project which related on High-Performance Computing

* I have done some formal verification research on large-scale distributation systems, also develops some tools for solving/detect problems
  * e.g., deadlock/ livelock, planning to pulish step by step.
* For GPU cluster, I was designed a full-stack system from kernel till services layer, the architecture is still confidential, but I may update some design cases for further disscusions
* On the bottom level of my doctorate project, GPU programming, utilized lots of CUDA-warp level features, combining lots of tricks developed by the machine learning community, may pulish some tools for verfication partions, kernal simluations, etc.

### Project Still Open to Public:

* Python native lisp embedding (My favourite during undergraduate) https://github.com/Ziang-Chen/Lisp
* HTML Based OS: https://github.com/Ziang-Chen/browse  Aim for further Agentic Based development, which running in fully contrallable, simple, predicatable enviroment
