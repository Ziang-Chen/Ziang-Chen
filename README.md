Hi, I'm Ziang Chen, come from King's College London ,UK. 

My Research interested in Differential Equation, Machine Learning and Field Theory. 

For Research Paper can also reference on my ResearchGate 

https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ziang-Chen-6

I Devoloped Flowing Project:

* Trajectory Forecasting in Self-Driving
* ODE for Propogration Modelling
* Robotics Dynamics Toolbox
* Differential Geometry Toolbox



The Paper & Code are in publishing slowly cause too many issues

There also a plan to devolope deep learning framework, based on my current projects, unify the interface with my own style, hope its come true early.

Below are some screenshot
